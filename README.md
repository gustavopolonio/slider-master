# About this Project

A simple project to fix some concepts about animation in Javascript. It has static data with the functionality to slide back and forth to show the data of some fictitious employees.

This project is part of my personal portfolio, so I would appreciate if you provide me any feedback about the ideia, code, structure or anything you could report to make me a better developer.

Feel free to use the Slider Master as you wish, either to study or make improvementes!

You can check out this project in action clicking [here](https://gustavopolonio.github.io/slider-master/).

# :construction_worker: Getting Started

## Prerequisites

Before starting, you need to have installed in your machine the [Git](https://git-scm.com/) and a editor to work with the code (I use [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/)).

## Installation

To clone this project via HTTPS, run the command:

```
  git clone https://github.com/gustavopolonio/slider-master.git

SSH URLs provide access to a Git repository via SSH, a secure protocol. If you have a SSH key registered in your Github account, clone this project using the command:

```
  git clone git@github.com:gustavopolonio/slider-master.git
```
</br>

Open the cloned project in your editor and install a Live Server to launch a development local server with live reload feature. If you are also using [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/), I recommend to install the extension [LiveServer](https://github.com/ritwickdey/vscode-live-server/blob/master/docs/settings.md).
Then start the live server and open the browser in the port number provided:

```
http://localhost:5500/<port_number>
```
