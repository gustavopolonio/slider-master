# About this Project

A simple project to fix some concepts about animation in Javascript. It's full responsive, has mobile-first approach and static data with the functionality to slide back and forth to show the data of some fictitious employees.

This project idea was taken from [Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/coding-bootcamp-testimonials-slider-4FNyLA8JL) and is part of my personal portfolio, so I would appreciate if you provide me any feedback about the ideia, code, structure or anything you could report to make me a better developer.

Feel free to use the Slider Master as you wish, either to study or make improvementes!

You can check out this project in action clicking [here](https://gustavopolonio.github.io/slider-master/).

# :construction_worker: Getting Started

## Prerequisites

Before starting, you need to have installed in your machine the [Git](https://git-scm.com/) and a editor to work with the code (I use [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/)).

## Installation

To clone this project via HTTPS, run the command:

```
  git clone https://github.com/gustavopolonio/slider-master.git
```

SSH URLs provide access to a Git repository via SSH, a secure protocol. If you have a SSH key registered in your Github account, clone this project using the command:

```
  git clone git@github.com:gustavopolonio/slider-master.git
```
</br>

Open the cloned project in your editor and install a Live Server to launch a development local server with live reload feature. If you are also using [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/), I recommend to install the extension [LiveServer](https://github.com/ritwickdey/vscode-live-server/blob/master/docs/settings.md).
Then start the live server and open the browser in the port number provided:

```
http://localhost:5500/<port_number>
```
